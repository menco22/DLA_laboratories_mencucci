---
This lab investigates the role of **residual connections** in mitigating vanishing gradients in deep neural networks, both in **MLPs** and **CNNs**, and explores **transfer learning and fine-tuning** for image classification. Starting from a simple MLP on MNIST, we progressively design and analyze convolutional architectures on CIFAR-10, with and without residual blocks. Finally, we transfer a pre-trained residual CNN to CIFAR-100, comparing *linear probing* and different fine-tuning strategies. All experiments are tracked using **Weights & Biases (wandb)** for monitoring.


## Theoretical Background

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
An **MLP** is a feed-forward neural network with multiple hidden layers. Each layer applies linear transformations followed by nonlinear activations, allowing the network to approximate complex functions.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
**CNNs** are designed for grid-structured data such as images. Convolutional layers use shared filters to extract local patterns and build hierarchical feature representations. **Residual networks (ResNets)** introduce residual connections, easing optimization and enabling very deep architectures.

### Residual Connections
Residual connections (or skip connections) are links that bypass one or more layers by adding the input of a layer directly to its output. Formally, a residual block computes:

$$
y = F(x) + x
$$

where 𝐹(𝑥) is the transformation applied by the block. These connections:
1. Mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks;
2. Facilitate the training of very deep architectures;
3. Allow layers to learn residual functions, making optimization easier;

They are the core idea behind ResNets, which achieve state-of-the-art performance while keeping extremely deep networks trainable.


### Fine-Tuning and Linear Probing
**Fine-tuning** adapts pre-trained models to new tasks:
- **Linear probing**: freeze the backbone and train only a new linear classifier.
- **Full fine-tuning**: update part or all of the backbone along with the classifier, achieving stronger adaptation but at higher computational cost.

## Objectives
- Analyze gradient propagation in deep **MLPs** with and without residual connections.  
- Design and train **CNNs** (plain vs residual) on CIFAR-10, assessing the effect of skip connections.  
- Apply **transfer learning** from CIFAR-10 to CIFAR-100:
  - Linear probe (frozen backbone).  
  - Fine-tuning.

## Datasets
- **MNIST** (28×28 grayscale, 10 classes) – baseline for MLP.  
- **CIFAR-10** (32×32 RGB, 10 classes) – convolutional architectures.  
- **CIFAR-100** (32×32 RGB, 100 classes) – transfer learning target.  

Data normalization and basic augmentation (random crop, horizontal flip) are applied. Validation splits are carved from the training sets for model selection.

## Architectures
### MLP (Baseline on MNIST)
- Experiment: depth vs gradient flow, with/without residual shortcut connections.

### CNNs on CIFAR-10
- **Non Residual CNN**: sequential ConvBlocks (Conv3×3 + BN + ReLU).  
- **Residual CNN**: ResidualBlock with identity/projection skip connections (1×1 conv for downsampling).  
- Architecture: Input layer → Residual Blocks (with downsampling at increasing depths) → Global average pooling → Fully connected classifier.

### Transfer Learning Backbone
- Pre-trained deep residual CNN on CIFAR-10.  
- Used as frozen feature extractor (linear probe) or progressively fine-tuned on CIFAR-100.


## Training Pipeline
- **Optimizer**: Adam (default),Adam/AdamW/Sgd/Sgd+momentum during Fine Tuning exercise.  
- **Scheduler**: ReduceLROnPlateau (factor=0.5, patience=2).  
- **Regularization**: early stopping (patience=5–6).  
- **Logging**: local + wandb (loss, accuracy, gradient flow, checkpoints).

## Experiments
### 1. Residual Connections in MLP
- Training deep MLPs on MNIST and verification of the effect of the residual connections.

### 2. Residual Connections in CNN
- CIFAR-10 experiments with non-residual vs residual CNNs.   

### 2.5 Improving the chosen model
- I took the 20-DEEP_RESIDUAL_CNN model and tried to improve its learning abilities as much as possible in view of the next exercise.

### 3. Transfer Learning & Fine-tuning on CIFAR-100 (Exercise 2.1)
- **Feature extractor + Linear SVM**: additional baseline using pre-trained embeddings.  
- **Linear probe (LP)**: freeze backbone, train only final classifier.    
- **Fine-tuning (FT0, FT1, FT2)**: progressively unfreeze layers.

## Results
- **Residual connections in MLP** mitigate vanishing gradients:

The deeper the mlp, the more you see the difference.

- **Residual CNNs** clearly outperform non-residual CNNs in convergence speed and final accuracy:

As seen before, the deepest the net get, the more the residual connection makes the difference, although in this case we have more of a phenomenon of gradient degradation rather than disappearance.

-**Improved Model** I have achieved good results in improving the performance of the chosen model

- **Feature Extractor Baseline** I extracted features from the last convolutional layer (before the fully-connected layer) of the pre-trained model on CIFAR-10.
These features were used to train a linear classifier (Linear SVM) on CIFAR-100 to establish a baseline performance. The accuracy obtained with this approach was **41.97%**.

- **Transfer learning** The model performed quite well after pre-training on cifar-10, considering the difficulty of the task on cifar-100.I experimented with different optimizer setups to see which one was best.

Linear Probing:

First Fine Tuning:

Second Fine Tuning:

From these results I had intuited that using adam or adamW as the optimizer would be the best strategy.

Third Fine Tuning (only AdamW):

We can see clear signs of overfitting, so I tried to improve the model's performance one last time with a more aggressive data augmentation:
